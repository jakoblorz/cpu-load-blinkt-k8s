# cpu-load-blinkt-k8s
This is code, a Docker image, and Kubernetes `DaemonSet` for the Pimoroni Blinkt! lights kit, in order to identify CPU load on each node in a Kubernetes cluster. This has been tested with HypriotOS on the RPI 3 B. The Python program is based on the Blinkt! cpu_load.py example, which can be found [here](https://github.com/pimoroni/blinkt/blob/master/examples/cpu_load.py).

This is very much not done yet! I hope to finish it soon! In the meantime, check out my current project, a [twitter trivia bot!](https://github.com/dvdmuckle/twitter-trivia-bot)
